# 👩‍🏫 Elementary School Class List Generator - V2 w/ Python 

This was a second-go at the first ever side project I worked on, back in 2017. [The first version](https://github.com/cbarrett3/elementary-classlist-generator) was built with Java, about a year earlier. This project was inspired by my mother, who is a first grade teacher and has explained this problem time and time again to me. The objective of this project was to make elementary school teacher's lives easier at the end of the school year, when they are asked to recommend classlists to the principal for the following school year.

This was my first ever python side-project, and I worked on this while in University outside of class. 

This is V2, and it's built using Python, Flask and Jinja2 Templates. The algorithm is cleaned up, more modular, and much more readable. It is still in need of some love - properly tested, secured, and refactored would all be great things to do. I'm keeping this here for a rainy day when I plan to come back to it.
